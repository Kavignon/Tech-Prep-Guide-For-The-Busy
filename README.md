# Data Structures and Algorithms for the busy developer

## Introduction

If you're looking for a new study plan to
- Study for a mid-term / finals on the topic.
- Pass a coding interview.
- Dusting off skills that you haven't practiced in weeks/months/years.
- learn because you're an avid learner

You've come to the right place.

Not everyone has either months or hundred/thousand of hours to invest learning about this fundamental core computer science / software engineering skill. This repository is a distilled summary information on grasping the core knowledge to either brush up or learn about DS+A quickly. The goal of this repository is to help developers who have about 2 to 4 weeks' worth of time to prepare and learn. I found that most guides online are geared towards people who have fro. months up to a year to prepare.

The goal of this guide isn't to be comprehensive. It should be seen a good resource on your journey of data structures and algorithms knowledge. After going through the material here, I suggest finding other resources to compliment and further what you've read on / practiced. In time, I hope the guide gets better summaries, illustrations,etc to help those in need. But as mentioned earlier, this isn't meant to replace what is already available for those who have ample amounts of time on their hands to learn.
